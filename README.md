# data_science_for_mathematicians
Working through all exercises and projects in Nathan Carter's "Data Science for Mathematicians"!

My advisor, Henry Adams, contributed to the final chapter (Topological Data Science), which incentivised me to buy this book.

As it turns out the rest of the chapters are great too. As a challenge, I am going to complete all the suggested exercises, projects, and challenges in this book. (Likely) all code will be written in Python/R/SQL, and all math will be written in LaTeX.
